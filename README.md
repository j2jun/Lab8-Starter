## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation and service workers are related in that both aim to improve the user experience in environments with varying levels of capability. Graceful degradation focuses on providing a functional user experience even when advanced features are not supported. Similarly, service workers enhance web applications by providing offline capabilities and improving performance, ensuring that the application remains functional even without a network connection. By caching assets and intercepting network requests, service workers help maintain a smooth user experience, aligning with the principles of graceful degradation.
